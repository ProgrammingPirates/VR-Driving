# We(V)-are(R)-Driving

## Description
Road accidents cost India 3-5% of gross domestic product every year and are avoidable if India could improve its driver's skills, and enforce strict & proper driving license tests, an Indiaspend analysis shows. 

India’s young, productive population, aged 18-45 years, is involved in 70% of road accidents due to lack of proper driving training, according to data from Road Accidents in India 2018, a report published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.
Over 24 years from 2014 to 2038, if India could halve the deaths and injuries due to road traffic, its GDP could increase by 7%, a 2018 World Bank report said.

In 2018, India had 467,044 reported road accidents, an increase of 0.5% from 464,910 in 2017, according to the road ministry’s data.
India has 1% of the world’s vehicles but accounts for 6% of the world’s road traffic accidents, according to data from a 2018 World Health Organization report. As many as 73% of all deaths due to road traffic accidents in 2018 in the South and South-East Asia region happened in India, the report said.

## What we are doing?

To contribute to our nation's growth, we are proposing an innovative method to train, test, and analyze the driving skills of India and Sweden's drivers heavy and light vehicle both before
releasing them on the roads with steering in the hands.

## How we are training drivers?

We have used the technology of Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and IoT to make the world's cheapest driving simulator
which can be used in homes too just by sitting on a desk with VR technology. A learner can select different scenarios for learning driving virtually at home only.

## How we are testing drivers?

Here the driver will be running the car in the physical world but face difficult obstacles in the virtual world before getting the license.
This cheapest simulator with the help of VR is used to test the skills of a driver by officials before assigning the driving license, here the driver's skills will be tested on the physical roads but the difference is the obstacles will be seen on the VR headset having our AR application.
Hence drivers have to wear the headset and drive the physical car.
The driver has to face various difficult scenarios for proper testing which are expensive to be set in the real world.

## How we are analyzing?
Our AR application with the help of AI is analyzing that how many times the driver broke the rules, hit the obstacles in the virtual world by driving in the physical world, and at the end, a whole report is generating whether the test is passed or failed.
